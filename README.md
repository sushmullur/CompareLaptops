Background information: 
This program is intended to help a user decide between 2-5 laptops. 
It utilizes information such as clock speed, storage capacity, type of storage technology, and price to 
determine the most cost efficient purchase to make. 

As this project is still underway, the UI is nowhere near complete or polished. The formula for calculating 
the efficiency or score of a laptop can be tinkered with further to produce more reliable and efficient results. 

Instructions: 
In order to use this program, run the UI.java file, choose the number of laptops you would like to compare and enter
in the information of the device in their respective text fields. The program will calculate and display
an "efficiency score" for each laptop.
